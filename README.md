# Games + Search Algorithms
In this assignment I implemented different game strategies and search algorithms using Haskell. The game strategies implemented for a tic-tac-toe game included min-max search and min-max search with alpha-beta pruning. The search algorithms included BFS, DFS, Depth Limited Search, Iterative Deepening Search, Best First Search and A* Search
